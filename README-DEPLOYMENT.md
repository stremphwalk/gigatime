# Gigatime - Vercel Deployment Branch

This branch is specifically configured for deployment to **Vercel** with **Supabase** as the database.

## Quick Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/stremphwalk/gigatime/tree/vercel-deployment)

## What's Different in This Branch

1. **Database Configuration**: Updated to support both Neon (dev) and Supabase (production)
2. **Vercel Config**: Added `vercel.json` for optimal deployment
3. **Production Environment**: Created production environment template
4. **Deployment Guide**: Comprehensive setup instructions

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone and Deploy
```bash
git clone -b vercel-deployment https://github.com/stremphwalk/gigatime.git
cd gigatime
```

### 2. Set Up Services
- **Supabase**: Create project and get DATABASE_URL
- **Auth0**: Configure callback URLs for your domain
- **Deepgram**: Get API key for voice recognition
 - **OpenAI**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` for server-side AI parsing. Keys are never exposed to the client; requests go through `/api/ai/*` endpoints.

### 3. Environment Variables
Copy `.env.production.example` and fill in your values:
- `DATABASE_URL` (from Supabase)
- `AUTH0_*` (from Auth0 dashboard)
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` (from Deepgram)

### 4. Deploy
```bash
# Push to GitHub and connect to Vercel
# Or use Vercel CLI
npx vercel --prod
```

### 5. Database Setup
```bash
# After deployment, run migration
npm run db:push
```

## Features Ready for Production

âœ… **Authentication**: Auth0 integration with secure JWT tokens  
âœ… **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with connection pooling  
âœ… **Voice Recognition**: Deepgram Nova-3-medical model  
âœ… **AI Parsing (Meds/Labs/PMH)**: Dictation â†’ cleaned structured text (no client flags)  
âœ… **Medical Templates**: Admission, Progress, and Consult notes  
âœ… **Security**: HTTPS, secure headers, environment isolation  
âœ… **Scalability**: Serverless deployment with auto-scaling  

## AI Features (Usage)

- Endpoints: `/api/ai/medications`, `/api/ai/labs`, `/api/ai/pmh` (server-side; requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- Client UI: an AI button appears next to section headers (left side) for Meds, Labs, and PMH.
- Workflow: click AI to start dictation, click again to process.
  - Meds/Labs: inserts structured text at the caret.
  - PMH: merges into a numbered list with indented details; preserves order and only appends details.
- Fallback: if AI fails/empty, raw dictated text is inserted at the caret.
