Place your brand images here.

Expected filename used by the app:
- arinote_full_256px.png (256x256 PNG)

This file is referenced in:
- /client/index.html (favicon, apple-touch-icon, Open Graph)
- Landing page logo component (client/src/pages/landing-new.tsx)

You can copy your existing logo into this folder, e.g.:
- arinote_full_256px.png

If you prefer different sizes, we recommend also adding:
- arinote_icon_32.png
- arinote_icon_192.png
- arinote_icon_512.png

Then update site.webmanifest accordingly.
